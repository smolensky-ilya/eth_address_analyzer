# ETH Address Analyser

## Introduction
The ETH Address Analyser is a cutting-edge data science tool designed for in-depth Ethereum (ETH) address analysis. This project emerged from the need for a more comprehensive platform than what's currently available - most existing tools offer limited insights into an ETH address's activities and strategies. Our tool bridges this gap, providing a "Swiss knife" for ETH address investigation, making it an indispensable asset for anyone looking to delve deep into Ethereum analytics.

## Features
- **Comprehensive Analysis**: Parses ETH address data from Etherscan and CoinGecko.
- **Data Visualization**: Creates detailed graphs and tables.
- **AI-Powered Conclusions**: Utilizes GPT models for insightful conclusions.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Streamlit web application for ease of use.
- **Real-Time Data Processing**: Options for historical or current token prices.
- **Adaptive Learning**: System learns with each analysis, storing data in a database for faster future processing.
- **Efficient Data Retrieval**: Once token prices and contract names are stored, they are reused instantly in future analyses.
- **Scam and Phishing Transaction Filter**: Ability to filter out scam and phishing transactions.
- **Outlier Detection**: Remove outliers in transaction data with customizable parameters.
- **Detailed Time Analysis**: Distribution of transaction times across days of the week.
- **Gas and Expense Analysis**: Detailed breakdown of gas usage and expenses by tokens and contracts.
- **Etherscan Integration**: Parsing name tags and contract names from Etherscan for enhanced data accuracy.
- **Shareable Analysis Link**: Generate a link to share the analysis with others.
- **Open Source**: Open for community contributions.

## How to Use
1. **Enter ETH Address**: Input a valid Ethereum address.
2. **Customize Parameters**: Adjust settings in the sidebar for specific analysis needs.
3. **View Results**: Examine the graphs, tables, and AI-generated conclusions.
4. **Share Your Analysis**: Use the shareable link to showcase your findings with others.

## Motivation
The inspiration for this project stems from the limitations of platforms like Etherscan, which, while useful, do not allow users to take a comprehensive look at a particular ETH address's activities and strategy. In response, ETH Address Analyser was developed to be the ultimate tool in ETH address analysis, offering detailed insights into strategies, fund flows, gas usage, transaction timings, and other critical analytics, all conveniently accessible in one place.
